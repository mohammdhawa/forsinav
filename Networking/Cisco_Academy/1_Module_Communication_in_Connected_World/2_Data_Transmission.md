## Common Methods of Data Transmission

After the data is transformed into a series of bits, it must be converted into signals that can be sent across the **network media** to its destination.

**Network Media**: refers to the physical medium on which the signals are transmitted.
Examples of media: copper wire, fiber-optic, and electromagnetic waves through the air.

There are three common methods of signal transmission used in networks:

- **Electrical Signals**: Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire.
- **Optical Signals**: Transmission is achieved by using converting the electrical signals into light pulses.
- **Wireless Signals**: Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwaves, or radio waves through the air.
