# MAC Addressing

MAC address is a physical (hardware-based) address. Unique identifier for network cards (NICs).

- Every node in the LAN is identified with help of MAC address.
- Unique and cannot be changed.

| IP Address                                | MAC Address                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| - Needed in communication.                | - Needed for communication.                |
| - 32 bits                                 | - 48 bits                                  |
| - Represented in decimal                  | - Represented in hexadecimal               |
| - Router needs IP address to forward data | - Switch needs MAC address to forward data |
