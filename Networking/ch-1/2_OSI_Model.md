1. **Physical Layer (Fiziksel katmanı)**: Manages the physical aspects of network communication, such as cables and signals.
2. **Data Link Layer (Veri Bağlantı Katmanı)**: Handles data framing, error detection, and device addressing for local network communication.
3. **Network Layer (Ağ Katmanı)**: Routes data between different networks, using logical addressing (IP address).
4. **Transport Layer (Ulaşım Katmanı)**: Ensures reliable end-to-end communication, including error detection and data segmentation.
5. **Session Layer (Oturum Katmanı)**: Establishes, maintains, and terminates communication session between application. 
6. **Presentation Layer (Sunum Katmanı)**: Translate, encrypts and compresses data to make it compatible with different systems.
7. **Application Layer (Uygulama Katmanı)**: Provides user interface and network services for applications to interact with the network.
